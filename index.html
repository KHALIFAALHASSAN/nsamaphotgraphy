    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">IT all started with a few pictures taken and edited for personal use back in September of 2018. It was only due to the the persistence, motivation and pressure from an Ex-lover that N Sama Photography was born.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Initially, I was using an Apple iPhone 6s and a Canon EOS 450D but mainly using my iPhone because it was the one device I always had on my person whenever I was out and about and the fact that I found the phone camera very easy to use. We hold these devices in our hands everyday but we almost never go deep enough to unlock the full potential of the said devices so I thought "Why not? After all, we use our phones to take pictures everyday" and I began taking pictures and editing them to show the world that our phones can be used for more than just selfies. </p>
    <p class="text_column">I then opted to stop using the digital camera at least for the mean time then went on with my phone. Within the 3 years I've been doing this, I've gone from using the 6s to the iPhone X, to the Xs Max, then currently, the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 12 Pro Max. All this to show that a phone camera can do almost everything a digital camera can. To this day, I have several people still in disbelief that all my pictures are taken and edited with my phone and that is the effect I was looking for. </p>
